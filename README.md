# Bon Appetit

​An application resembling UberEats, Bon Appetit is a food pick-up ordering system for a theoretical ice cream parlor. Customers can place orders and receive status updates via a dynamic order status page and text message notifications.

The app allows a customer(user) to place an order and a restaurant to notify the user the status of their order via a dynamic order status page and text message notification.

* Front-end built using HTML/CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Javascript, AJAX
* Backend was built using Node.js, Express, and PostreSQL
* Twilio API (modern telecomm API service) was used to allow text message or audio communication between the customer and restaurant
